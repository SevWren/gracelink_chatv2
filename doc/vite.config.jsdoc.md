# JSDoc: `vite.config.ts`

## Overview

`vite.config.ts` is the configuration file for Vite, the build tool used in this project. It defines how the project is built, served in development, and what plugins are used.

## Configuration Object

The file exports a default object generated by `defineConfig` from Vite.

### Key Properties:

-   **`plugins: PluginOption[]`**
    -   **Description:** An array of Vite plugins to use.
    -   **Current Value:** `[react()]`
        -   This includes the official `@vitejs/plugin-react`, which provides React-specific functionalities like Fast Refresh (HMR) during development and JSX transformation.

-   **`base: string`**
    -   **Description:** The base public path when served in production. This is crucial for correct asset loading when deploying to a subpath of a domain (e.g., GitHub Pages).
    -   **Current Value:** `'/gracelink_chat/'`
    -   **Note:** The comment `// IMPORTANT: Replace 'gracelink_chat' with your GitHub repository name` indicates that this value needs to be customized based on the deployment target repository name.

-   **`build: BuildOptions`**
    -   **Description:** Options related to the production build process.
    -   **Current Value:**
        ```typescript
        {
          outDir: 'dist',
        }
        ```
        -   `outDir: string`: Specifies the output directory for the production build files. Defaults to `dist`.

## Usage

This file is automatically used by Vite CLI commands like `vite dev` (for starting the development server) and `vite build` (for creating a production build). No direct interaction is typically needed unless modifying the project's build or development server behavior.
